Zend_Feed_Reader TODO
=====================

1. Complete refactoring of Dublin Core support to an extracted class.
2. Implement Dublin Core support for Atom feeds.
3. Implement Atom support as an extension to RSS/RDF
4. Feed interpreting behaviour should utilise the following standard priority
   for RSS feeds (need tests to verify this!):
        - RSS Elements
        - DC Elements
        - Atom Elements
5. Should be possible to avoid unnecessary querying via XPath by detecting
   Atom/DC support and avoiding any Atom/DC instance calls if not supported.
6. Implement value decoding scheme for simple text strings.
7. Examine feasibility of HTML filtering against using a whitelist approach.
8. Examine the links between ZFR and ZF. Should ZFR optionally control feed loading?
9. Implement caching solutions including feed caching, Conditional HTTP GET, and preservation of internal class member caching.
10. Implement a plugin system to support both standard and custom plugins
